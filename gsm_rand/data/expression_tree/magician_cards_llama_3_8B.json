If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find.

Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.

How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.",
        "response": "Let's think step by step. First, let's find the number of green cards. We know that there are 226 blue cards, and 50% more green cards. Since 50% more means 1.5 times more, we can say that there are 1.5 times more green cards than blue cards. So, 1.5 times more means 1.5 times 226 = <<1.5*226=339>>339 green cards.\nNext, we know that yellow cards are as many as the sum of blue and green cards. So, we can write this as: yellow cards = blue cards + green cards. We can substitute the numbers we have for the colors to get: yellow cards = 226 + 339 = <<226+339=565>>565.\nFinally, we can add the number of blue cards, green cards, and yellow cards to find the total number of cards: 226 + 339 + 565 = <<226+339+565=1130>>1130 cards.\n#### 1130",

Alice used 18 tokens which are worth 20 pitches each, so 18 tokens x 20 pitches = <<18*20=360>>360 pitches.\nGrace used 16 tokens x 20 pitches = <<16*20=320>>320 pitches.\nTogether, Alice and Grace received 360 + 320 = <<360+320=680>>680 pitches.\nAlice hit the ball 13 times + Grace’s 17 hits = <<13+17=30>>30 total hits.\nOf the 680 pitches – 30 total hits = <<680-30=650>>650 misses.\n#### 650\n\nQuestion: In a set of athelete's cards, there are 136 blue cards, and 50% more purple cards. orange cards are as many, as the sum of blue and purple cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.",
        "response": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the number of purple cards. If there are 136 blue cards and 50% more purple cards, then the number of purple cards is 136 + (50% of 136) = 136 + (0.5 * 136) = 136 + 68 = 204.\nNext, we need to find the number of orange cards. We know that the number of orange cards is as many as the sum of blue and purple cards, so we can write an equation: x = 136 + 204. Solving for x, we get x = 340.\nFinally, we need to find the total number of cards. We know that there are 136 blue cards, 204 purple cards, and 340 orange cards, so the total number of cards is 136 + 204 + 340 = 680.\n#### 680",

First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find.
