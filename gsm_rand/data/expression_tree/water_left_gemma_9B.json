If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find.

First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find.

Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. Noah ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nBob ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nIn total they ate 8 because 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8.\nOn average they ate 4 because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4.\n#### 4\n\nQuestion: Alice and Grace went to the batting cages.

        "prompt": "Question: Diana is cutting up wood for his wood-burning stove. Each apples tree makes 65 logs, each bottles tree makes 54 logs, and each pencils tree makes 68 logs. If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.

Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. Noah ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nBob ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nIn total they ate 8 because 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8.\nOn average they ate 4 because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4.\n#### 4\n\nQuestion: Alice and Grace went to the batting cages.

Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. Noah ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nBob ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nIn total they ate 8 because 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8.\nOn average they ate 4 because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4.\n#### 4\n\nQuestion: Alice and Grace went to the batting cages.

        "prompt": "Question: Diana is cutting up wood for his wood-burning stove. Each apples tree makes 65 logs, each bottles tree makes 54 logs, and each pencils tree makes 68 logs. If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find.
