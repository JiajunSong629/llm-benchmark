        "prompt": "Question: Diana is cutting up wood for his wood-burning stove. Each apples tree makes 65 logs, each bottles tree makes 54 logs, and each pencils tree makes 68 logs. If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob went to the batting cages.

The second biggest toys is 120 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 40 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest toys compared to the second biggest toys?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the ride length of the biggest toys: 480 feet / 30 feet/minute = <<480/30=16>>16 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest toys: 120 feet / 40 feet/minute = <<120/40=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 16 minutes - 3 minutes = <<16-3=13>>13 minutes\n#### 13\n\nQuestion: A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 240 floors.

If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob went to the batting cages.

The second biggest toys is 120 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 40 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest toys compared to the second biggest toys?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the ride length of the biggest toys: 480 feet / 30 feet/minute = <<480/30=16>>16 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest toys: 120 feet / 40 feet/minute = <<120/40=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 16 minutes - 3 minutes = <<16-3=13>>13 minutes\n#### 13\n\nQuestion: A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 100 floors.

If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob went to the batting cages.

The second biggest toys is 120 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 40 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest toys compared to the second biggest toys?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the ride length of the biggest toys: 480 feet / 30 feet/minute = <<480/30=16>>16 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest toys: 120 feet / 40 feet/minute = <<120/40=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 16 minutes - 3 minutes = <<16-3=13>>13 minutes\n#### 13\n\nQuestion: A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 120 floors.

If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob went to the batting cages.

The second biggest toys is 120 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 40 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest toys compared to the second biggest toys?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the ride length of the biggest toys: 480 feet / 30 feet/minute = <<480/30=16>>16 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest toys: 120 feet / 40 feet/minute = <<120/40=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 16 minutes - 3 minutes = <<16-3=13>>13 minutes\n#### 13\n\nQuestion: A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 200 floors.

Noah used 11 tokens which are worth 10 pitches each, so 11 tokens x 10 pitches = <<11*10=110>>110 pitches.\nBob used 13 tokens x 10 pitches = <<13*10=130>>130 pitches.\nTogether, Noah and Bob received 110 + 130 = <<110+130=240>>240 pitches.\nNoah hit the ball 13 times + Bob’s 18 hits = <<13+18=31>>31 total hits.\nOf the 240 pitches – 31 total hits = <<240-31=209>>209 misses.\n#### 209\n\nQuestion: The biggest toys at Five Flags is 480 feet long, and people slide down at 30 feet/minute. The second biggest toys is 120 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 40 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest toys compared to the second biggest toys?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the ride length of the biggest toys: 480 feet / 30 feet/minute = <<480/30=16>>16 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest toys: 120 feet / 40 feet/minute = <<120/40=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 16 minutes - 3 minutes = <<16-3=13>>13 minutes\n#### 13\n\nQuestion: A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 243 floors.
