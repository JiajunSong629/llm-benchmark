        "prompt": "Question: Diana is cutting up wood for his wood-burning stove. Each apples tree makes 65 logs, each bottles tree makes 54 logs, and each pencils tree makes 68 logs. If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. Noah ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nBob ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nIn total they ate 8 because 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8.\nOn average they ate 4 because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4.\n#### 4\n\nQuestion: Alice and Grace went to the batting cages. Each token gets you 20 pitches. Alice used 18 tokens and Grace used 16 tokens. Alice hit the ball 13 times and Grace hit the ball 17 times. How many pitches did Alice and Grace miss altogether?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. Alice used 18 tokens which are worth 20 pitches each, so 18 tokens x 20 pitches = <<18*20=360>>360 pitches.\nGrace used 16 tokens x 20 pitches = <<16*20=320>>320 pitches.\nTogether, Alice and Grace received 360 + 320 = <<360+320=680>>680 pitches.\nAlice hit the ball 13 times + Grace’s 17 hits = <<13+17=30>>30 total hits.\nOf the 680 pitches – 30 total hits = <<680-30=650>>650 misses.\n#### 650\n\nQuestion: In a set of artist's cards, there are 184 red cards, and 50% more green cards. orange cards are as many, as the sum of red and green cards.

First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.

First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. Noah ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nBob ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nIn total they ate 8 because 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8.\nOn average they ate 4 because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4.\n#### 4\n\nQuestion: Alice and Grace went to the batting cages. Each token gets you 20 pitches. Alice used 18 tokens and Grace used 16 tokens. Alice hit the ball 13 times and Grace hit the ball 17 times.

First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.

First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.

First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. Noah ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nBob ate 4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4.\nIn total they ate 8 because 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8.\nOn average they ate 4 because 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4.\n#### 4\n\nQuestion: Alice and Grace went to the batting cages. Each token gets you 20 pitches. Alice used 18 tokens and Grace used 16 tokens. Alice hit the ball 13 times and Grace hit the ball 17 times.

Alice used 18 tokens which are worth 20 pitches each, so 18 tokens x 20 pitches = <<18*20=360>>360 pitches.\nGrace used 16 tokens x 20 pitches = <<16*20=320>>320 pitches.\nTogether, Alice and Grace received 360 + 320 = <<360+320=680>>680 pitches.\nAlice hit the ball 13 times + Grace’s 17 hits = <<13+17=30>>30 total hits.\nOf the 680 pitches – 30 total hits = <<680-30=650>>650 misses.\n#### 650\n\nQuestion: In a set of magician's cards, there are 184 blue cards, and 50% more purple cards. yellow cards are as many, as the sum of blue and purple cards. How many cards of all mentioned colors are there?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the number of purple cards: 184 blue cards * 50% = <<184*50/100=92>>92 more purple cards.\nSo there are 184 + 92 = <<184+92=276>>276 purple cards.\nThen find the number of yellow cards: 184 blue cards + 276 purple cards = <<184+276=460>>460 yellow cards.",

If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Noah's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 rolls up long while Bob's was 2 roll-ups wide and 2 roll-ups long. If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.
