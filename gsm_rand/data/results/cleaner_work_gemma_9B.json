If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob went to the batting cages.

If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob went to the batting cages.

Noah used 11 tokens which are worth 10 pitches each, so 11 tokens x 10 pitches = <<11*10=110>>110 pitches.\nBob used 13 tokens x 10 pitches = <<13*10=130>>130 pitches.\nTogether, Noah and Bob received 110 + 130 = <<110+130=240>>240 pitches.\nNoah hit the ball 13 times + Bob’s 18 hits = <<13+18=31>>31 total hits.\nOf the 240 pitches – 31 total hits = <<240-31=209>>209 misses.\n#### 209\n\nQuestion: The biggest toys at Five Flags is 480 feet long, and people slide down at 30 feet/minute. The second biggest toys is 120 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 40 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest toys compared to the second biggest toys?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the ride length of the biggest toys: 480 feet / 30 feet/minute = <<480/30=16>>16 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest toys: 120 feet / 40 feet/minute = <<120/40=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 16 minutes - 3 minutes = <<16-3=13>>13 minutes\n#### 13\n\nQuestion: A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 120 floors. They have 10 days to get it done. It takes them 40 minutes per floor.

If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob went to the batting cages.

If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob went to the batting cages. Each token gets you 10 pitches. Noah used 11 tokens and Bob used 13 tokens. Noah hit the ball 13 times and Bob hit the ball 18 times.

Noah used 11 tokens which are worth 10 pitches each, so 11 tokens x 10 pitches = <<11*10=110>>110 pitches.\nBob used 13 tokens x 10 pitches = <<13*10=130>>130 pitches.\nTogether, Noah and Bob received 110 + 130 = <<110+130=240>>240 pitches.\nNoah hit the ball 13 times + Bob’s 18 hits = <<13+18=31>>31 total hits.\nOf the 240 pitches – 31 total hits = <<240-31=209>>209 misses.\n#### 209\n\nQuestion: The biggest toys at Five Flags is 480 feet long, and people slide down at 30 feet/minute. The second biggest toys is 120 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 40 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest toys compared to the second biggest toys?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the ride length of the biggest toys: 480 feet / 30 feet/minute = <<480/30=16>>16 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest toys: 120 feet / 40 feet/minute = <<120/40=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 16 minutes - 3 minutes = <<16-3=13>>13 minutes\n#### 13\n\nQuestion: A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 162 floors. They have 6 days to get it done. It takes them 20 minutes per floor.

        "prompt": "Question: Diana is cutting up wood for his wood-burning stove. Each apples tree makes 65 logs, each bottles tree makes 54 logs, and each pencils tree makes 68 logs. If Diana cuts up 10 apples trees, 2 bottles trees, and 3 pencils trees, how many logs does he get?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First find the total number of apples logs by multiplying the number of trees by the number of logs per tree: 65 logs/apples * 10 apples = <<65*10=650>>650 logs\nThen do the same thing for the maple trees: 54 logs/bottles * 2 bottles = <<54*2=108>>108 logs\nAnd do the same thing for the walnut trees: 68 logs/pencils * 3 pencils = <<68*3=204>>204 logs\nFinally, add up the number of logs from each type of tree to find the total number: 650 logs + 108 logs + 204 logs = <<650+108+204=962>>962 logs\n#### 962\n\nQuestion: Noah and Bob went to the batting cages. Each token gets you 10 pitches. Noah used 11 tokens and Bob used 13 tokens. Noah hit the ball 13 times and Bob hit the ball 18 times. How many pitches did Noah and Bob miss altogether?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. Noah used 11 tokens which are worth 10 pitches each, so 11 tokens x 10 pitches = <<11*10=110>>110 pitches.\nBob used 13 tokens x 10 pitches = <<13*10=130>>130 pitches.\nTogether, Noah and Bob received 110 + 130 = <<110+130=240>>240 pitches.\nNoah hit the ball 13 times + Bob’s 18 hits = <<13+18=31>>31 total hits.\nOf the 240 pitches – 31 total hits = <<240-31=209>>209 misses.\n#### 209\n\nQuestion: The biggest toys at Five Flags is 480 feet long, and people slide down at 30 feet/minute. The second biggest toys is 120 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 40 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest toys compared to the second biggest toys?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\nFirst find the ride length of the biggest toys: 480 feet / 30 feet/minute = <<480/30=16>>16 minutes\nThen find the ride length of the second biggest toys: 120 feet / 40 feet/minute = <<120/40=3>>3 minutes\nThen subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 16 minutes - 3 minutes = <<16-3=13>>13 minutes\n#### 13\n\nQuestion: A maintenance worker has to clean a university with 105 floors. They have 7 days to get it done. It takes them 28 minutes per floor. If they work 10 hours each day, what percentage of their day, on average, is spent cleaning floors?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step. First, find the number of floors the worker needs to clean per day: 105 / 7=<<105/7=15>>15. Then find the number of minutes to work per day: 15 * 28 =<<15*28=420>>420.",
