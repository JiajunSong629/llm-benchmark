There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 minutes in 1 hour. 10 hours * 60 minutes = <<10*60=600>>600 minutes in 10 hours.\nNow we can figure out what percentage of the time the maintenance worker is spending cleaning floors. We do this by dividing the number of minutes it takes to clean all 126 floors by the number of minutes in 10 hours: 3780 minutes / 600 minutes = <<3780/600=6.3>>6.3.\n6.3 is a decimal, so we need to change it into a percent.
