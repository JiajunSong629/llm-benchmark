If Kimia is sure to get 60% of the geography questions, and 1/9 of the algebra and chemistry questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?",
        "original_answer": "The literature and chemistry questions comprises 100% - 60% = 40% of the quiz.\nThere are 150 questions x 60/100 = 90 history questions.\nThere are a total of 150 questions x 40/100 = 60 literature and chemistry questions.\nIf Mia is sure to get 40% of the history questions, then this means she is sure of her 90 questions x 40/100 = 36 points.\nFrom the literature and chemistry questions, she is sure to get 1/10 of it correctly so that is 60 questions * 1/10 = 6 points.\nThus, she is sure of getting 36 points + 6 points = 42 points in her quiz.\n#### 42",
