        "new_question_answer": "Dr. Johnson paid $450000 x 2/100 = $9000 for the legal fees.\nHe paid $450000 x 6/100 = $27000 for the realtor fee.\nSo, Dr. Johnson paid a total of $9000 + $27000 + $310000 = $346000 for the legal, realtor, and loan fees.\nHence, Dr. Johnson's net proceeds is $450000 - $346000 = $104000.\n#### 104000",
        "response": "Let's think step by step. First, calculate the legal fees: 2% of $450000 is (2/100) * $450000 = $9000. Next, calculate the realtor fee: 6% of $450000 is (6/100) * $450000 = $27000. The total expenses are $9000 + $27000 = $36000.  Now, subtract the total expenses and the remaining loan amount from the selling price: $450000 - $36000 - $310000 = $84000. The answer is $84000. #### $84000"
