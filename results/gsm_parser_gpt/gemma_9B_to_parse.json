        "new_question_answer": "They have to clean 20 rooms a day because 180 / 9 = 20\nThey spend 300 minutes cleaning per day because 20 x 15 = 300\nThey spend 5.0 hours a day because 300 / 60 = 5.0\nThey spend 0.5 of their day cleaning rooms because 5.0 / 10 = 0.5\nThey spend 50% of their day cleaning rooms because 0.5 x 100 = 50\n#### 50",
        "response": "Let's think step by step. The cleaner has to clean 180 rooms. It takes them 15 minutes per room. So it will take them 180 * 15 = 2700 minutes to clean all the rooms. 10 hours is 10 * 60 = 600 minutes. So the cleaner will spend 2700 / 600 = 4.5 hours per day cleaning rooms. 4.5 hours is 450 minutes. So the cleaner will spend 450 / 600 = 0.75 = 75% of their day cleaning rooms. The answer is 75. #### 75"
