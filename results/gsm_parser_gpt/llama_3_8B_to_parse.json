Since hay are a rare treat, he only buys five 4-kg boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the alpacas while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys twelve 5-kg bags. Corns are the main diet of his alpacas, so he buys thirty two 38-kg packs. Oats are a staple to supplement the corns, so he buys nineteen 16-kg sacks.
